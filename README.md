# Heart Disease Prediction

This project contains a Jupyter/Colab notebook for **Heart Disease Prediction** using machine learning techniques.  
The dataset is analyzed, preprocessed, and used to train models that can predict the likelihood of heart disease.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- `Heart.ipynb` â€” The main notebook with data analysis, visualization, and model training.
- `README.md` â€” Project documentation.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
cd <your-repo-name>
2. Open in Google Colab

You can run the notebook directly in Google Colab without installing anything locally:
3. Run Locally (Optional)

If you want to run it locally:
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook Heart.ipynb
ðŸ“Š Features

Data preprocessing & cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Machine learning model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

ðŸ›  Requirements

Python 3.6+

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

(If running in Colab, these come pre-installed.)

ðŸ“Œ Notes

The dataset is included/linked inside the notebook.

You can tweak model parameters and compare performance.
